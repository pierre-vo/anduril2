luxdrv 0.3 was my first firmware. It features short-cycle memory, ramping,
battery monitoring (reduces brightness when batt is low, and has a battery
level indicator).

It's source code is available here(1), it's free for private and noncommercial
use for members of BudgetLightForum.com and Taschenlampenforum.de

luxdrv 0.4 is it's successor.
Key features: Short-cycle memory, Ramping, programmable (i.e. modes are
configurable by the user, by a number of taps), the number of modes can be
changed, too. Has low-batt step-down (reduces brightness when battery is low)
and battery indicator.
