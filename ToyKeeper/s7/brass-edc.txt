This is a slightly modified version of the firmware for my Convoy 
S7-219B, which is itself a heavily-modified version of JonnyC's STAR 
on-time firmware.

The hardware I'm using is a first edition of CNQG / FancyFlashlight's 
"Brass 18650 EDC" light, with a XP-G2 R5 3B at 1400mA.  (at least, until 
I upgrade the emitter to a Nichia 219B ~5000K 92CRI)

The modes are as follows:  (with output measurements from my personal light)

- 1 tap: moon / 0.45 lm
- 2 taps: low / 8.9 lm
- 3 taps: med / 46.6 lm
- 4 taps: high / 173.6 lm
- 5 taps: max / 403 lm  (no turbo step-down)
- 6 taps: 1Hz moon-med flasher (actually, off-med due to a bug)
- 7 taps: 1Hz low-high flasher
- 8 taps: 1Hz med-max flasher
- 9 taps: 10Hz true strobe
- 10 taps: 24Hz true strobe (my favorite)
- 11 taps: 60Hz true strobe
- 12 taps: ~7Hz to ~18Hz self-ramping strobe
- 13 taps: ~16Hz to ~100Hz self-ramping strobe
- 14 taps: 1Hz heartbeat beacon

It uses "short-cycle" memory, so the next tap will reset to the first 
mode after it has been on for one full second.  This means you don't 
have to go through all the blink modes to get back to moon or low.

Every mode except 'moon' uses fast PWM (18 kHz).  Moon mode uses 
phase-correct 9 kHz PWM.

The "flasher" modes blink 4 times quickly on the higher of the two 
levels, then stay on at the lower level, and repeat this cycle once per 
second.  The timing is roughly 5ms for each blink, 65ms between, then 
720ms of additional low mode until it starts over.  This is good for 
high-visibility when you need to both see and be seen, such as on a 
bike.

All strobes are "true" motion-freezing strobes, not tactical strobes.

The self-ramping strobes are just for fun.  Point one at a spinning fan.

There is a low-voltage monitor, but I'm 100% sure it has bugs.  It will 
detect low voltage but it might not behave well after noticing the 
situation.  If the light starts blinking slowly, that means the voltage 
is low and you should probably shut it off soon.

No settings can be configured by soldering stars.  You'll need to 
recompile and reflash to change anything.
