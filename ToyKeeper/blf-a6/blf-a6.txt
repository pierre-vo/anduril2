BLF EE A6 firmware
==================

The interface is as follows:
  (see blf-a6-ui.png for a quick start)

  While off:

    - Fully click and release to turn the light on.  It will go to the 
      first mode or the last-used mode, depending on whether you enabled 
      mode memory.

  While on:

    - Short tap: Do a short (less than 0.5s) half-press to go forward to 
      the next mode.
    - Med tap: Do a medium (0.5s to 1.5s) half-press to go backward to 
      the previous mode.
    - Long tap: Do a long (longer than 1.5s) half-press to reset to the 
      first mode (if mode memory is turned off).
    - Or fully click and release to turn the light off.

  Hidden modes:

    - Go backward from moon to access the hidden modes.  They are, in 
      order:
      - Turbo (just like the regular turbo)
      - Tactical strobe (10 Hz)
        (or 2-level stutter beacon, if compiled with that option)
      - Battery check / beacon mode
        (each blink represents about 25% of a full charge)

  Configuration options:

    - Ground pin 3 of the MCU to enable mode memory.  This can often be 
      done by soldering a star on the spring side of the driver, if your 
      driver supports that.  Otherwise, it's pretty easy to make a 
      solder bridge from pin 3 (mode mem toggle) to pin 4 (ground).  Or 
      even just wedge a piece of metal between the two pins.

    - Short tap rapidly a bunch of times (15+ taps, or until the light 
      stops turning on) to enter soft config mode.

      With the default build, this only has one option (mode group), and 
      it will toggle that option each time config mode is entered.  It 
      will then blink, pause, and return to regular operation with the 
      new settings.

      Or if you rebuild the source and enable more than one soft config 
      option, the way it works is the light will blink twice for each 
      option.  Turn the light off between the two blinks to toggle that 
      option.  The options are whichever ones you enable.

      The available options are:

      - Mode group: 7 modes or 4 modes:
        Group 1: moon, low, med1, med2, high1, high2, turbo
        Group 2:       low,      med,       high,     turbo

      - Mode memory toggle (disabled in default build, use pin 3 instead)

  Other details to note:

    - Low-voltage protection will progressively step down the output at 
      about 2.8V, and the light will shut itself off when it gets below 2.7V.

    - The default turbo step-down is 30 seconds.

    - When turbo steps down to high, a short tap will push it back up to 
      turbo or a medium tap will step down further, *even if you got to 
      turbo by going backward from moon*.  The step-down effectively 
      moves it from the "hidden" turbo back to the non-hidden turbo.

    - A short tap from any hidden mode will return to the lowest mode.

Compared to other commercially-available lights (especially budget 
lights), this light is unique or groundbreaking in several ways:

  - First BLF light with our own custom driver.
  - First BLF light with our own custom firmware.
  - First special-edition with a direct-drive FET, so it has the 
    brightest turbo mode you can get.
  - First special-edition with a regulated lower-power second channel 
    for stable and efficient low modes.
  - True moon mode.
  - Up to 1600 lumens from a single emitter in a small tube light (with 
    the right battery, and a spring bypass mod).  Closer to 1200-1300 
    lumens with no mods and lower-amp batteries.
  - User-toggle-able mode memory.
  - User-toggle-able mode groups.
  - Well-spaced visually-linear output modes.
  - Includes some hidden modes for those who want them.
  - Battery check mode!
  - First clicky-switch stock light with both forward and backward mode 
    navigation in a single tap (short/medium press).
  - With mode memory off, the user can access 4 different modes 
    (including the highest and lowest) within 1 second.
  - Fast PWM so the pulsing won't be visible.
  - The firmware and the driver designs are available for anyone who 
    wants to modify them.
