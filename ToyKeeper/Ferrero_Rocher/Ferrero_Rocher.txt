This UI is similar to STAR momentary.  The interface is:

From off:

  - Short press to enter the lowest level.
  - Long press to enter the highest level.  Keep holding to step down to 
    lower levels, and release when the desired level is reached.
  - Short-then-long press to display battery status and then shut off.

While on:

  - Short press to increase brightness level.
  - Long press to decrease brightness level.  Keep holding to keep 
    decreasing.

The long press (and hold) action will stop when it reaches the "off" 
state, so you can always shut the light off by holding the button down.

Turbo step-down (90 seconds) and low-voltage protection are enabled by 
default.

The battery check mode will blink up to five times:

  - 0 blinks: < 3.0V
  - 1 blink : 3.0V to 3.3V
  - 2 blinks: 3.3V to 3.6V
  - 3 blinks: 3.6V to 3.9V
  - 4 blinks: 3.9V to 4.2V
  - 5 blinks: > 4.2V

You may want to enter the battery check mode more than once to get a 
better idea of the battery state, because the readings tend to vary 
significantly each time.  Also, the first reading may not be correct if 
the light was just connected to power or not recently used.

It is recommended that you charge the battery when it has one or two 
blinks.
