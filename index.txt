This is a quick explanation of the contents of this repository and the 
purpose of each entry or each directory.

Most of the firmware here is for ATTINY13A chips.  Other architectures 
will be noted when appropriate.

  JonnyC/STAR/

    The "STAR" family of firmware.  At least, the base versions.  Makes 
    a good base for new firmwares, since STAR has most of the ground 
    work figured out already.

    STAR is designed for NANJG 105C drivers with an ATTINY13A MCU.

  JonnyC/STAR/Dual_switch/

    STAR for lights which have both a hard clicky switch and a momentary 
    electronic switch.

  JonnyC/STAR/SRK_no_ramp-Werners_UI/

    STAR for the Skyray King, modified with Werner's user interface.
    Should also work on other lights with an electronic switch.

  JonnyC/STAR/SRK_with_ramp/

    Not actually implemented yet.

  JonnyC/STAR/STAR_off-time_memory/

    STAR for lights with only a hard clicky switch, with an extra 
    capacitor added to the driver to help determine how much time passed 
    while the light was off.

  JonnyC/STAR/STAR_on-time_memory/

    STAR for lights with only a hard clicky switch.

  ToyKeeper/s7/

    ToyKeeper's custom firmware for a Convoy S-series light modded with 
    Nichia 219B and 5x7135 380mA chips for 1900mA maximum power.

  ToyKeeper/tail-light/

    Firmware designed for use as a bike tail light, ideally with a red 
    emitter driven by a 2x7135 nanjg 105c driver.  The AK-47A driver is 
    a good starting point.

  alexvh/basic_off_time_driver/

    Nanjg 105C firmware which implements off-time memory without an 
    off-time capacitor.

  bin/

    Miscellaneous scripts which might be useful.

  hello_world/

    A quick mod of STAR_on-time designed simply to test if the build and 
    flash tool chains are working.

  tterev3/pic10f322-examples/

    Fairly simple example firmwares for PIC10F322 chips, and a good base 
    for derivative projects since a lot of the plumbing is already 
    written.
